# FilePost
### Social file sharing for the rest of us!

FilePost is a file sharing service built to be quick and personal. Rather than taking the traditional direct link approach to file sharing, we use rooms to group users together and allow them to directly send files to anyone or everyone in the group. Room codes are selected from a choice of English words, since it's easier to tell your friend to join with room code "coffee" than it is with room code "MXBA", for instance. From the room, you can select one or many people and upload files to send to them. You'll get a small notification when you've received a file, and from there you can choose to download or ignore it. All of this is wrapped in an uncluttered user interface that makes sending and receiving files a breeze.

## Runnning the Server
Change the `host` variable in `main.py` to whatever host you're using, then run
```
python3 main.py
```
